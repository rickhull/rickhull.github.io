# COFFEE TIME

*(sung to the tune of Wild Blue Yonder)*

```
Coffee time! It is the time for coffee!
Caffeine high, into the sun
Coffee time! I'm ready to drink my coffee!
Get crackin' boys! The day has begun!

Coffee time! It is the time for coffee!
Let's push off, into the morn (storm)
We toil away, we sieze the day,
We can't fall asleep until the next horn!
```
