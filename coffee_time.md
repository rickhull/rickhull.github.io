# COFFEE TIME

*(sung to the tune of Wild Blue Yonder)*

```
Coffee time! It is the time for coffee!
Caffeine high, into the sun
Coffee time! I'm ready to drink my coffee!
At em boys! The day has begun!

Coffee time! It is the time for coffee!
Send me off, into the morn
We toil away, we sieze the day,
We can't fall asleep until the next horn!
```
