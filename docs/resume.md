## Objective

I seek to join a team that builds highly available systems to address
important problems and business opportunities.  My teammates and
I would share my passion for excellence in engineering while recognizing

library and API development, and other forms of back-end programming.

## Key Qualifications

* Broad understanding of machine learning techniques
* Several years of hardcore cloud computing experience from inside and out
* Recognition that we live in a distributed world and must (eventually)
  respond with distributed solutions
* Startup mentality: see a gap, fill a gap (many hats)
* Extensive experience designing and implementing applications, libraries,
  and tools using object-oriented and functional methodologies
* Rapid absorption and adoption of unfamiliar technologies
* Excellent problem-solving and critical-thinking skills
